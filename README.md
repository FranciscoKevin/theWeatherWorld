# theWeatherWorld

Small weather web application that uses the Openweathermap API.
It displays the current weather of the geolocated position if the user wishes, or displays the weather of the city sought.

- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JS
- Framework Bootstrap

- I used here not the Fetch method for requests, but the old XMLHttpRequest method
  to discover and learn.
